# InterloperSite
A site I'm treating this as a sandbox to experiment with AngularJS and Node. I'll probably send my mom here the next time she asks what I do all day. 
Built with Node, Express, AngularJS with custom directives/components, hot sauce (obviously Cholula... maybe Tapatio), and probably some jQuery.
