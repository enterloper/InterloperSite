Thank you for your interest in my site! This repository has the majority of code that makes up my personal website which I'm treating as a sandbox to experiment with API construction, database creation with PostgreSQL, animation  jQuery, and server side rendering via Express and Node. In addition, this site will also showcase blogs, my personal approach to solving toy-problems via code and video, and projects I've built independently as well as with groups. Built with Node, Express, jQuery, Handlebars, Knex and SQL.
